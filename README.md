**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**:
I HAVE CREATED AN "API KEY INTEGRATION", TASK 1: DEVELOP A RESPONSIVE WEBPAGE THAT FETCHES AND DISPLAYS DATA FROM A PUBLIC API. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT IS THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A REAL-TIME WEB APPLICATION THAT INTEGRATES ONE OOR MORE PUBLIC APIS. SO FIRST I LEARNED ALL THE SHORTCUTS OF THE HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPTS SYNTAXES. I BEGAN MY TASK ONE BY REVISING AND PRATICING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX AND LEARNED SOME FRONTEND-BACKEND INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES.
THEN I HAVE USED YOUTUBE PLATFORM FOR LEARNING HOW TO CONNECT FRONTEND AND BACKEND COMPONENTS EFFICIENTLY. THIS HELPED ME VISUALIZE THE STRUCTURE AND LOGIC FLOW OF THE PROJECT, AND ALLOWED ME TO IMPLEMENT NEW IDEAS AND TROBLESHOOT ISSUES FASTER.THIS PROJECT NOT ONLY IMPROVED MY UNDERSTANDING OF WEB DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO INTRODUCED ME TO THE API KEY USAGE.
I HAVE USED AI TOOLS LIKE REPLIT, CHATGPT AND DEEPSEEK FOR CODE UNDERSTANDING AND DIFFICUILTY. I HAVE USED CHATGPT AND DEEPSEEK TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES DURING DEVELOPMENT. THESE TOOLS HELPED ME UNDERSTAND SYNTAX, DEBUG CODE, ANS EXPLORE BEST PRACTICES FOR API INTEGRATION.
AS PART OF THE INTERNSHIP, I HAVE DEVELOPED A RESPONSIVE WEBPAGE USING API INTEGRATION WHICH DISPLAYS THE REAL-TIME DATA USING PUBLIC API KEYS. THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF:
*OPENWEATHERMAP API TO SHOW CURRENT WEATHER BASED ON USER INPUT.
*GNEWS TO FETCH TOP NEWS HEADLINES DYNAMICALLY.
*WEBSITES OR TECHNOLOGIES OR PLATFORMS USED ARE:
>HTML, CSS(RESPONSIVE DESIGN, FONT INTEGRATION
>JAVASCRIPT(FETCH API)
>OPENWEATHERMAP API, GNEWS API
>CHATGPT, DEEPSEEK AND REPLIT
OUTCOME:
I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CREATED A FULLY FUNCTIONAL WEBPAGE THAT FETCHES AND DISPLAYS BOTH WEATHER DATA AND LATEST NEWS ARTICLES.
